        <h1 class="knowledge_h1">Covariance matrices - nothing is certain</h1>

        <h2 class="knowledge_h2">Everything is Gaussian (so far)</h2>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            As was stated in the introduction to linear inverse theory topic, "we'll assume that the data, $in d $in,
            and model, $in m $in, are from a Gaussian distribution and have associated errors". We subsequently ignored
            the variance terms when we derived our cost function. So let's now be concrete and lay out what our cost
            function ought to be if we included those terms. We'll also include a model prior as well along with all
            associated errors and assume the model is linear, however we have already seen how to solve non-linear
            problems in the introduction to non-linear inverse theory section and the same workflow applies here.
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_eq">$$C = ||d-Gm||^{2}_{d} + ||m-m_{prior}||^{2}_{m}$$</p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Here a subscript to the L2-norm denotes that the norm subject to the variance present in the parameter
            shown. Concretely this would provide the following cost function when we expand the L2-norm
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_eq">$$C = (d-Gm)^{T}C_{d}(d-Gm) + (m-m_{prior})^{T}C_{m}(m-m_{prior})$$</p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Here the $inC_{x}$in variable denotes the covariance matrix for the variable x. The covariance matrix,
            $inC_{x}$in has size equal to $inN_{x} X N_{x}$in where the diagonal terms denote the variance of each
            element of $inx$in and the off-diagonal terms denote the covariance of the elements of $x$ with each other.
            The derivation of the equation for the solution of m follows the same process as for the linear case and the
            resultant equation for the solution is
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_eq">
            $$ m = (G^{T}C_{d}^{-1}G + C_{m}^{-1})^{-1} (G^{T}C_{d}^{-1}d + C_{m}^{-1}m_{prior}) $$
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            An important point that has been overlooked in the explanations thus far is that what we are calling our
            estimated model parameters are in fact the mean of an a posteriori model distribution. This a posteriori
            distribution is Gaussian in nature where the mean is given by the model solution and the posterior model
            covariance matrix defines the shape. We must assume that the input data and model are also Gaussian
            distributed each with their own defined covariance matrices.
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            The a posteriori model covariance matrix is given by
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_eq">$$ \tilde{C_{m}} = (G^{T}C_{d}^{-1}G + C_{m}^{-1})^{-1} $$</p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            We now have a framework for solving our problems, whether they are linear, pseudo-linear, or non-linear for
            some model parameters. Typically though, we have some idea of what our solution might be, or at least the
            general shape or values, so how can we impart this knowledge into our problem such that we can constrain the
            inversion and direct, or guide, it towards the kind of solution we expect? This process is typically called
            regularization and will be the theme of our next series of topics on various ways to regularize our
            inversions.
