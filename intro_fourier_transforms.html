        <h1 class="knowledge_h1">Fourier Transforms - looking at the frequencies</h1>

        <p>
            We have introduced frequencies and even tried to assess qualitatively the appearance of a signal in terms of
            "higher" and "lower" frequencies. But how can we quantitatively assess the frequencies of a signal? If we
            could fit an analytic signal, or series of them, to a form a spike then we could fit any digital signal as a
            digital signal is, in essence, a series of spikes of varying amplitude at distinct measurement points. It
            turns out that a series of sine (or cosine) waves with various amplitude, frequency, and phase can be fit
            together to from a spike. Specifically, one could sum cosine waves of zero phase, constant amplitude, and
            varying frequencies to generate a spike at t=0. Then all that is required to phase shift the component
            cosines to move the spike in time.

            This means that any digital signal can be approximated by a series of cosines of varying amplitudes,
            frequencies, and phases. This is known as a Fourier series. The fitted amplitudes, frequencies, and phases
            can now be assessed to determine how strong each frequency is represented in the signal. For instance, one
            would expect a good fit for a sine wave with a period of a year to data relating to average temperatures
            over time for the UK.<br><br>
            We can do this because, assuming there are no infinity data points in our series, we only have finite
            discountinuities. This is one of the Dirichlet conditions that must be met to eb able to represent a signal
            as a Fourier series. What would this look like mathematically?<br><br>
            $$
            s(t) = \frac{a_{0}}{2} + \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_{n}\cos(2\pi n t/T+\theta_{n})
            $$
            <br>
            Note that we have a coefficient out front of $\frac{a_{0}}{2}$ which accounts for the average of the signal.
            For instance if we wanted to fit a flat, non-zero response then $a_{0}$ would correspond to twice the
            average of the signal and all other coefficients would be zero. We can also write this equation in terms of
            sines and cosines without any phase term as sine and cosine form an orthogonal set:<br><br>
            $$
            s(t) = \frac{a_{0}}{2} + \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}b_{n}\cos(2\pi n t/T) + c_{n}\sin(2\pi n t/T)
            $$
            <br>
            Where $ina_{n} = \sqrt{b_{n}^{2} + c_{n}^{2}}$in and $in\theta_{n} =
            \tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{c_{n}}{b_{n}}\right)$in.<br><br>
            This is a representation of a real valued series as a Fourier Series, however we can also extend this to
            complex valued signals as well by exchanging sines and cosines for a complex exponential:<br><br>
            $$
            s(t) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=-\infty}a_{n}e^{2i\pi n t/T}
            $$
            <br>
            However, if we have infintesimally small separations between the discrete frequencies then we can think of
            this series in terms of an integral:<br><br>
            In practice it turns out that it is rather difficult to accurately assess frequencies close to the Nyquist
            frequency so a "rule of thumb" is applied by many practioners as to what frequencies can be recorded
            accurately. Although these rules of thumb vary, many would assume that frequencies measured between 90% and
            100% of the Nyquist frequency too inaccurate for further analysis. This is compounded by the fact that many
            signals are typically bounded by windowing functions that impose their own spectrum on the recorded signal
            (this will be covered in the section on convolution).
