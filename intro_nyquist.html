        <h1 class="knowledge_h1">The Nyquist frequency</h1>

        <p class="knowledge_p">The Nyquist frequency is the maxmimum frequency which can be seen within a signal for a
            given sampling interval and is defined by:<br><br>
            $inF_{n} = F_{s}/2$in<br><br>
            Where $inF_{n}$in is the Nyquist frequency and $inF_{s}$in is the sampling frequency.<br><br>
            This means that the physical phenomenon which you are recording may be verying at a much higher rate than
            you realise and what you see in the data is an aliased version of that signal. So what happens to high
            frequency recorded at a low sampling rate? What frequency will it appear and what is aliasing?
        </p>

        <h2 class="knowledge_h2">Aliasing</h2>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            <!-- TODO fill with some text and images about aliasing, maybe a gif/video? How do frequencies alias back to the recordable range of frquencies etc-->
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Sometimes the data/meta-data that is missing from the set we have can be more important than the data that
            is there, especially if there is an important underlying reason why that data is missing. A classic example
            is given in the book "How Not To Be Wrong" by Jordan Ellenberg which I highly recommend reading (the
            relevant excerpt can be seen here:
            <a
                href="https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d">link</a>,
            as well as on many people's LinkedIn posts!) as it highlights an important lesson; that the absence of data
            can be
            as informative as the data at hand. Much like understanding the space between objects in art is important,
            so
            is the space between recorded data points in science.
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">We've had a look at how some frequencies can be recorded faithfully and some will be
            aliased back tot he range of recordable frequencies but how can we tell what frequencies are present in a
            signal and to what degree? Can we decompose our signal into frequencies? All these questions will be
            answered in the next section on Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms</p>
