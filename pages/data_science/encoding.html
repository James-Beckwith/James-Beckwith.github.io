        <h1 class="knowledge_h1">Encoding for categorical variables</h1>

        <h2 class="knowledge_h2">Why do we need to encode variables?</h2>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            It is common to have a dataset that consists of some categorical variables. For example, a lot of data is
            captured about people and may contain fields such as "sex", "nationality", or "employment status". Location
            data may have a "country" field but datasets can also have context specific categorical variables too such
            as the "embarked" and "survived" features in the popular <a
                href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/titanic">titanic dataset</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Most machine learning techniques requires numeric input features so categorical and text features need to be
            transformed prior to their use in these models.
        </p>

        <h2 class="knowledge_h2">Ordinal Encoding</h2>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            You may be thinking, my data is already numerical because each category has just been assigned a unique
            integer. Fantastic, so long as those numbers are normalized, or at least not too large, then you can use
            them and this is in fact the first encoding technique we'll be looking at; Ordinal Encoding.
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Ordinal encoding, sometimes called integer encoding, is a method for converting categorical variables by
            assigning each new unique category entry the next largest integer number. For example, the feature ['cat',
            'dog', 'rabbit', 'cat'] could be encoded to [0, 1, 2, 0]. This is simple and uses the least resources to
            create and store the feature as each category is stored as an integer value. Missing, unknown, or unseen
            values can also be stored in an unused integer, typically -1. However, this approach also adds structure to
            the categorical values that may be counter productive. In our previous example, the encoding would imply
            that a 'rabbit' is twice as far from a 'cat' than a 'dog' and a 'dog' is as far from a 'cat' as it is a
            'rabbit'. This imparted structure can cause issues, especially if the model being used assumes that these
            numbers are continuous or that the magnitude is important.
