            A neural network is a network of neurons which take some input features from a training dataset and map them
            to
        </p>

        <h2 class="knowledge_h2">What is a neuron?</h2>
        <p class="knowledge_p">
            A neuron is a basic building block a neural network. A neural network, at a basic level, is a network of
            neurons which process some input feature(s), potentially with some other information, to produce a result.
            The result is numerical but this could be interpreted as the probability that the output belongs to a
            certain class, mapped back to a word embedding (more on that in the natural language processing section) or
            interpreted as an image. But what <i>is</i> a neuron?
        </p>
        <p class="knowledge_p">
            A neuron, can be any basic building block that can be defined mathematically. Not everything that can be
            defined will be useful as a neuron in a neural network though and some standard useful forms of neurons have
            been discovered and used over the years since they were first described by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 (<a
                href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02478259">link</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="knowledge_p">
            One of the most simple form of a neuron is one with a weight matrix, $in W$in, an additive bias, $in b$in,
            and an activation function, $in \textit{g}$in. The cross-product of any input feature vector with the weight
            matrix is formed, the additive bias added, and then this result is passed through the activation function
            (more on activation functions later as there are numerous commonly used functions with different uses).
        </p>

        <img src="../../resources/myImgs/ds/basic_neuron.png" alt="A diagram of a basic neuron" class="knowledge_img">

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Mathematically, a neuron is represented by:
        </p>
        <p class="knowledge_eq">
            $$\theta(X) = g\left(W^{T}X + b\right)$$
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            The weight matrix, $in W$in, has dimensionality equal to the number of input features by the number of
            expected output dimensions, which could be 1 or could be many. The bias term, $in b$in, is a single value
            that is added.
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            These neurons can be combined into layers, connected to one-another in linear or cyclical manners, and in
            some instance be much more complicated than is shown here. The entire collection of neurons is referred to
            as the network, whose job it is to map the input features to an expected value or class. Which neurons are
            used and how they are arranged and connected is referred to as the neural network architecture. These neural
            networks have to be trained to produce the mapping between input features and output labels.
        </p>

        <h2 class="knowledge_h2">How to train a neural network</h2>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Certain neural network architectures might have their own unique learning processes or workflows but a
            basic, generic workflow for training a neural network is the following:
        </p>

        <pre>Initalize the weights
while a stopping metric is not met:
    Pass the input features through the network to form a prediction
    Form the current loss between the predicted output and the true labels using the chosen loss function
    Back propagate this loss through the network to update the weights and biases using the chosen optimizer
        </pre>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            There are three key parts to this generic workflow:
        <ol>
            <li>Stopping metric</li>
            <li>Loss Function</li>
            <li>Optimizer</li>
        </ol>
        We'll go through each of these in turn to describe what they are used for but we will go into loss functions and
        optimizers in their own dedicated pages.
        </p>
