        </h2>
        <p>
            A lot of very useful data science packages can be used without any knowledge of the underlying algorithms. A
            lot of the technical aspects of a machine learning model are hidden away behind an app, user interface, or
            API endpoint. These solutions are typically referred to as machine learning as a service (MLaaS) and you may
            not even be aware of when one is being used. For instance, when a website recommends another product to buy,
            you order a taxi through an app, or use the latest filter on instagram. To build and implement these systems
            requires detailed knowledge not only of machine learning algorithms but, crucially, of the context of that
            problem. The hope is, that after digesting the information within these topics, that you will have the
            necessary skills and knowledge to start solving real world problems within your domain with some machine
            learning algorithms. To that end, we will focus heavily on the underlying algorithms and not on the MLaaS
            offerings that are available. Although, we would always recommend seeing if a solution for your problem
            already exists embarking on producing your own solution.
            <br><br>
            A lot of data science techniques necessitate the use of some programming language, typically python, SQL, or
            R. However, we won't be covering these languages here. We assume a knowledge of python and the relevant data
            science packages that might be used in python; pandas, tensorflow, sci-kit learn. We also assume that you
            have an understanding of the matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualization as well as the standard
            python suite and numpy. Most of the practical examples given in these topics will be written in python.
            <br><br>
            It is also assumed that you have the requisite mathematical and statistical knowledge to understand when and
            why
            to apply certain statistical tests and the validity of assumptions used.

                Basic data science solutions in python
            </summary>
            In this section we'll go through some basic examples of implementing data science solutions via fully
            connected neural networks and an ensemble method (Random Forest). These will be written in python and using
            the tensorflow and sci-kit learn packages. The idea here is to not provide a detailed introduction to what
            these algorithms <i>do</i> but to provide a quick introduction into how to implement these solutions in
            common packages. We'll go into a detailed description of these algorithm in later sections.<br><br>

            Typically your dataset won't be perfect. It will require some amending, some fixing, and some finessing to
            get it into a format and structure that you can use in your models and will help you optimize the
            performance of those models. <br><br>
