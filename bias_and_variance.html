        <p class="knowledge_p">
            The choice of polynomial in this example is important as it relays our understanding of the physical model
            which gave rise to the recorded data. This understanding might be based on scientific principles such as
            locating earthquake epicentres using a eucliand distance metric. However, we might not know the underlying
            physical principle, or there might not be one, in which case we have much more freedom to specify the
            complexity of the model we choose to fit to our data. There are two key concepts to consider when choosing
            the complexity of the model to fit to the data; underfitting and overfitting.<br><br>

            <!-- TODO clean this up a little bit and add examples -->
            By choosing a very simply model, such as a straight line (a 1<sup>st</sup> order polynomial), we may not be
            able to fully capture the variance (intracacy) in the data and the model we form might not be representative
            of the underlying statistical distribution of data and may not be useful for predictive purposes or for
            drawing conclusions about the current data. By choosing a highly complex model, such as a very high order
            polynomial, we risk fitting not only the underlying distribution of data but also the noise within the data,
            i.e. we overfit the recorded data as we fit the noise as well. This can have devasting consequences for
            extrapolating this model outside the range of values covered by the data used for the inversion.
