        <h1 class="knowledge_h1">Can you make your problem linear?</h1>

        <h2 class="knowledge_h2"></h2>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            We want our problem to solve to be in the form
        </p>
        <p class="knowledge_eq">$$d = Gm$$</p>
        <p class="knowledge_p">
            However, some problems won't be linearly separable like this and will take some re-arranging to get into
            this form. Even then, we simply won't be able to put some problems into this form. In this section we'll
            look at an example of a problem that initially doesn't fit into this form but can be linearized with a but
            of re-arranging.
        </p>
        <h2 class="knowledge_h2">An example of a non-linear problem that can be linearized</h2>
        <p class="knowledge_p">
            In our problem we have at the moment we will look at Moore's Law, which is a theory that states that the
            average number of transistors in integrated circuits doubles every 2 years (approximately). We will fit an
            exponential curve to data of the number of transistors in integrated circuits over the years to see if this
            rule holds. The form of the curve to fit a basic exponential of the form
        </p>
        <p class="knowledge_eq">$$N = Ae^{Bt}$$</p>
        <p class="knowledge_p">
            The first problem will come across is that this exponential equation doesn't easily fit into our $in d=Gm
            $in formula. But can we transform the equation somehow to fit into this formula?<br><br>Okay, enough
            teasing, if we take the natural log of both side of this equation then we can separate out the model
            variable into a simple multiplication of model variables and the environmental variables which will be used
            to form the forward operator, $in G $in
        </p>
        <p class="knowledge_eq">$$\ln{N} = \ln{A} + Bt$$</p>
        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Now this new form of the equation is a simple straight line fit the model variables being to $in \ln{A} $in
            and $in b $in. From here we can use the same approach as in the linear least squares regression example but
            with an even simpler forward operator as we no longer need the quadratic term in in the $in X $in variable
            (which
            will be time in our example).
        </p>
        <p class="knowledge_eq">
            $$G=
            \begin{bmatrix}
            x_{1} & 1 \\
            x_{2} & 1 \\
            \vdots & \vdots\\
            x_{Nd} & 1 \\
            \end{bmatrix}
            $$
        </p>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            In terms of applying this in python, we follow the exact same logical as we used before with the exception
            that we now pre-process our data by taking the natural logarithm of the recorded data (number of transistors
            in this example) before sending the data into the functions that we made in the linear least squares
            topic.<br><br>
            First we'll read in the data from a CSV file, extract the data and take it's natural logarithm, and also
            extract the time samples
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">df = pd.read_csv('moores_law.csv', header=None)
transistors = np.log(df[0].values.T)
year = df[1].values.T</code></pre>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            Note that we have taken the transpose of the data values, this is important as the inverse procedure
            involves multiplying matrices in which case the orientation of the data is important. For instance, if we
            want the matrix product $in G^{T}G $in to be square and of size $in N_{m} $in x $in N_{m} $in then the
            forward operator needs to be created such that each row corresponds to the environmental variables for each
            specific data example, i.e. in this example each row corresponds to the specific time instance of the
            recorded data. If the data was arranged differently then the calculation couldn't be done using the equation
            we have set out thus far. You could reformulate the equation for this new paradigm though.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">polynomial_degree = 1
model = linearInversion(transistors, year, polynomial_degree, 0)
plotting(transistors, year, model, 'ln(transistors)','year', polynomial_degree)</code></pre>

        <p class="knowledge_p">
            The model we have fit agrees remarkably well with Moore's law and shows that the average number of
            transistors in an integrated circuit is doubling every 2.03 years (to 2 decimal places). We come to this
            conclusion by noting that if the number of transistors were to double this would be equivalent to an ln(2)
            increase in the natural log of the number of transistors. Given the gradient above, how many years would it
            take to reach an increase of ln(2)? The answer would be ln(2) divided by the gradient, which is
            approximately 2.03.

            The method used here to linearize our problem may not always work and it may not be possible to linearize
            our problem. In this case, what do we do? A common solution to this scenario is given in the next section
            where we will cover non-linear least squares inversion.
